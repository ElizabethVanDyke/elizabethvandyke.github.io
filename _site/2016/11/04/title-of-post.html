      <p>This is the first monologue of Hotspur in Henry IV part one:</p>

<p>My liege, I did deny no prisoners. 
But I remember, when the fight was done, 355</p>

<p>When I was dry with rage and extreme toil, 
Breathless and faint, leaning upon my sword, 
Came there a certain lord, neat, and trimly dress’d, 
Fresh as a bridegroom; and his chin new reap’d 
Show’d like a stubble-land at harvest-home; 360</p>

<p>He was perfumed like a milliner; 
And ‘twixt his finger and his thumb he held 
A pouncet-box, which ever and anon 
He gave his nose and took’t away again; 
Who therewith angry, when it next came there, 365</p>

<p>Took it in snuff; and still he smiled and talk’d, 
And as the soldiers bore dead bodies by, 
He call’d them untaught knaves, unmannerly, 
To bring a slovenly unhandsome corpse 
Betwixt the wind and his nobility. 370</p>

<p>With many holiday and lady terms 
He question’d me; amongst the rest, demanded 
My prisoners in your majesty’s behalf. 
I then, all smarting with my wounds being cold, 
To be so pester’d with a popinjay, 375</p>

<p>Out of my grief and my impatience, 
Answer’d neglectingly I know not what, 
He should or he should not; for he made me mad 
To see him shine so brisk and smell so sweet 
And talk so like a waiting-gentlewoman 380</p>

<p>Of guns and drums and wounds,—God save the mark!— 
And telling me the sovereign’st thing on earth 
Was parmaceti for an inward bruise; 
And that it was great pity, so it was, 
This villanous salt-petre should be digg’d 385</p>

<p>Out of the bowels of the harmless earth, 
Which many a good tall fellow had destroy’d 
So cowardly; and but for these vile guns, 
He would himself have been a soldier. 
This bald unjointed chat of his, my lord, 390</p>

<p>I answer’d indirectly, as I said; 
And I beseech you, let not his report 
Come current for an accusation 
Betwixt my love and your high majesty.</p>
